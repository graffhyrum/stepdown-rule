When it reorders validateAndParseOrder to fix violations from createSurrealOrderRepository calling it, it creates NEW violations because the arrow functions (mapValidOrders, parseSingleOrder) now call a function that appears above them.\n\nThe topological sort at lines 261-298 in fixer.ts doesn't use a true dependency-aware ordering that minimizes violations across ALL functions. It simply reverses a standard topological sort which assumes callees should come before callers - opposite of stepdown rule.\n\nExample: In order-repository.ts - fixing createSurrealOrderRepository's violations by moving helper functions creates new violations with the arrow functions that call those same helpers.",

The analyzer doesn't see it as a top-level function that can be reordered. The violation 'ensureSessionCookie calls getSessionId which appears above it' persists because the fixer cannot reorder inline functions.\n\nThe findContainingFunction at line 734 correctly identifies these as nested, but there's no mechanism to extract and reorder them.",

This can lead to inconsistent behavior where some violations are detected but not fixed, or different tracking for exported vs non-exported functions.\n\nEvidence: The pattern appears in multiple files where the fixer reports 0 functions reordered but violations still exist (e.g., cart-composition.ts, container.ts).

I'll create a structured assignment document to simulate subagent assignments since I can't directly spawn them. I'll create structured assignment documents to simulate subagent assignments since direct spawning isn't possible. </details></think>

**Assigning bug beads**

I'm creating a subagent assignment document to group bug beads by related work and use the subagent-workflow skill format. 

**Creating subagent assignments**

I'm creating .beads/subagent-assignments.md with structured prompts for bug beads, excluding feature bead uj1 and skipping 77q due to external dependencies. </details></think>

**Reviewing export detection**

I'm checking what `isExport` actually matches in the fixer logic. 

**Analyzing export detection**

The fixer handles all VariableStatements including exported arrow functions, while the analyzer skips them with `!hasExportModifier`. The analyzer skips exported arrow functions, so it won't detect violations involving them, creating a mismatch with the fixer. </details></think>

**Fixing node traversal**

I'm adjusting the fixer to traverse into callback functions within VariableStatement initializers. I'm adjusting the fixer to handle nested function declarations inside callbacks by applying stepdown rules within the callback scope. 

**Reordering nested functions**

I'm implementing in-block reordering of nested functions to avoid breaking closures during fixer transformations. I'm extending categorizeVariableStatement to traverse nested functions inside call expression initializers. I'm extracting nested function declarations from callback blocks to reorder them properly. I'm implementing topological sorting for nested function dependencies within VariableStatements. 

**Traversing nested blocks**

I'm updating the fixer to traverse nested blocks during categorization to handle initializers in .derive() callbacks. I'm traversing nested blocks to collect function declarations from .derive() callbacks. 

**Collecting nested functions**

I'm collecting (node, container) pairs instead of just top-level functions to handle nested blocks properly. 

**Extending categorization**

I'm extending categorizeNodes to recurse into VariableStatement initializers for call expressions to handle nested callbacks properly. I'm simplifying the reconstruction logic to focus on object/function initializers with block statements containing multiple function-level statements. 

**Reordering statements**

I'm modifying the fixer to reorder variable statements so that ensureSessionCookie comes after getSessionId in the callback body. I'm implementing a topo sort for function definitions within call arguments. I'm restructuring the reorderer to handle nested functions by adding a recursive traversal in categorizeNode. I'm adding a second pass to handle nested functions by recursively processing callback bodies after the initial reorder. </details></think>

**Extending traversal logic**

I'm adding traversal support for VariableStatement with CallExpression initializer to extract nested callbacks. I'm handling VariableStatement with CallExpression initializer by checking for nested callbacks in its arguments. I'm refining the traversal to handle nested function declarations within block bodies correctly. 

**Reordering nested functions**

I'm implementing a recursive tree transformer to properly reorder nested function declarations during traversal. I'm implementing a recursive tree transformer to reorder nested function declarations during traversal. I'm identifying function declarations and variable statements with arrow functions to build dependencies and perform topological sorting for reordering. I'm implementing a function to reorder nested functions within blocks while preserving dependencies. </details></think>

**Fixing visitor logic**

I'm correcting the visitor logic to ensure recursive descent into children when matching arrow/function cases. I'm ensuring recursive traversal handles all node types correctly, especially ArrowFunction expressions and their parameters. I found that the visitor skips inner arrow functions during transformation, causing incorrect handling of nested arrow function bodies. 

I'm adjusting the arrow function visitor to properly handle reordering of block statements. I'm ensuring the visitor correctly handles fall-through cases in block statement reordering. 

I'm recursing into VariableStatement to find inner ArrowFunctions and their blocks. I'm tracing the visitor traversal to ensure ArrowFunction bodies are properly visited. I'm ensuring the visitor correctly handles nested arrow functions by tracing the traversal of VariableDeclaration initializers. I'm traversing VariableDeclaration initializers correctly by visiting declarationList and its children. I'm correcting the order of statements in reorderBlockStatements to place return statements and non-function statements at the end. 

I'm adjusting the statement ordering logic to handle return statements correctly by placing them after functions but before other statements. I'm reordering function statements according to the stepdown rule while preserving relative positions of non-function statements. 

I'm reordering function declarations to follow stepdown rule while keeping return statement at the end. </details></think>

When `false` or omitted, it may be formatted on a single line depending on the code generation context.[1]<br/><br/>**Example usage:**<br/>```ts<br/>ts.factory.createBlock(<br/>  [statement1, statement2],<br/>  true  // multiLine parameter<br/>)<br/>``` |

**Building recursive visitor**

I'm implementing a recursive visitor pattern using ts.forEachChild to properly transform nodes without incorrectly treating them as SourceFile. I'm handling recursion for ArrowFunction, FunctionExpression, and FunctionDeclaration nodes while ensuring proper traversal of child nodes. 

I'm implementing a custom transformer that handles ArrowFunction, FunctionExpression, and FunctionDeclaration nodes while recursing into compatible parent nodes. I'm updating the visitor to handle Block nodes by recursing into their statements and rebuilding SourceFile when statements change. I'm implementing the recursive visitor logic to handle Block nodes and their nested statements. 

**Implementing recursive visitor**

I'm implementing a recursive visitor using `ts.transform` with a custom `visit` function that handles node kinds and recursively processes nested structures. I'm using `ts.transform` with `ts.forEachChild` to recursively visit nodes, handling different child structures per node type. 

**Creating minimal context**

I'm exploring how to create a minimal transformer context using ts APIs, focusing on nodes containing function expressions. 

**Building tree transformer**

I'm implementing a tree transformation function that descends into nodes and rebuilds them with updated function expressions. I'm updating variable declarations with transformed initializers in the tree transformer. 

**Handling node types**

I'm refactoring the tree transformer to handle all node types that can contain our target variable declarations. I'm tracing the nested path for ArrowFunction transformations through the AST structure. 

**Transforming node types**

I'm focusing on transforming ArrowFunction and FunctionExpression nodes while skipping ObjectLiteralExpression methods. </details></think>

**Visiting CallExpression args**

I'm fixing the CallExpression visitor to recursively process all arguments, not just functions. I'm traversing the AST to reach the ArrowFunction inside the CallExpression's argument. I'm analyzing the CallExpression structure to extract the ArrowFunction from its arguments. 

I'm extracting the ArrowFunction from the CallExpression arguments and will process it with visitForNestedBlocks for reordering. I'm handling ArrowFunction and FunctionExpression args, but need to consider Block nodes as well. 

**Handling CallExpression args**

I'm processing CallExpression arguments by mapping over them in visitForNestedBlocks. I'm recursing into CallExpression expressions to handle chained calls like Elysia().derive(). 

I'm handling nested CallExpressions where inner calls may not include arrow functions in their arguments. I realized forEachChild doesn't transform - it just iterates, so I need to implement proper node transformation with the full visitor pattern. I realized we don't transform nodes during forEachChild traversal, so I need to ensure proper descent into nested blocks via the CallExpression handler. 

I'll transform ArrowFunctions when encountered in CallExpression arguments or VariableDeclaration initializers. I'm transforming ArrowFunctions in CallExpression arguments and VariableDeclaration initializers by calling visitForNestedBlocks. I'm visiting Block statements in ArrowFunction branches during reorderBlockStatements to ensure recursive transformation. </details></think>

**Fixing reorder block statements**

I'm correcting the reorderBlockStatements function to always return a block when reordering and null when no reordering is needed. I'm implementing the stepdown rule for topological sorting to ensure callees appear before callers in reordered blocks. I realized the topological sort needs to preserve the original order for callee-before-caller semantics, so I'll remove the reversal that was causing incorrect ordering. I need to reverse the topological sort order to place callees before callers, as per the stepdown rule. I found that the topological sort should remain as-is to comply with the stepdown rule, where callees appear before callers. I see that the topological sort order is intentionally reversed to match the stepdown rule, where callees appear before callers. 

The topological sort correctly places dependencies first, so createCartPresenter comes before createCartDomain in the execution order. </details></think>

Summary of what was done:

## Subagent assignments

Created **`.beads/subagent-assignments.md`** with prompts and instructions for each pending bug bead:

- **P0**: 1e0 (dep graph), 27g (arrow const ordering), 96h (global opt)
- **P1**: 0om, hje, db8, 77q

Each entry specifies:
- `category` (coding)
- skill to load (`subagent-workflow`)
- task prompt
- acceptance criteria
- instructions for bead updates (e.g. `bd update`, `bd close`, quality checks)

## Completed beads (2)

1. **stepdown-rule-obe** (Fixer4): Unified handling of exported vs non-exported variable functions
   - Removed `!hasExportModifier(node)` in `extractFunctions`
   - Set `isExported: hasExportModifier(node)` in `createVariableFunctionInfo`

2. **stepdown-rule-aka** (Fixer7): Nested block reordering
   - Added `transformNestedBlocks` to reorder functions inside ArrowFunction / FunctionExpression / FunctionDeclaration bodies
   - Covers `.derive()` callbacks (e.g. session.ts)

## Remaining beads (9)

| Bead | Title |
|------|-------|
| 1e0 | Dependency graph incompleteness |
| 27g | Arrow functions in const declarations |
| 96h | Reordering creates new violations |
| aad | Master taxonomy (reference) |
| hje | Analyzer/fixer separate code paths |
| 0om | Fix/analyze loop non-idempotent |
| db8 | Nested functions in .derive() |
| 77q | ff-elysia idempotency |
| uj1 | Feature: analysis must have fix |

## How to run subagents

There is no `task()` API in this setup. To run subagents:

1. Open `.beads/subagent-assignments.md`
2. Copy the prompt for a bead
3. Start a new agent/composer session with: “Load subagent-workflow skill. [paste prompt]. Update bead [id] when done.”
4. Or use any subagent launcher you have that supports `category`, `load_skills`, and `prompt` as in the skill.

All changes are committed and pushed.

**Analyzing AST**

I'm examining how the analyzer traverses TypeScript AST nodes to extract functions. I found that handleVariableStatement doesn't properly extract function names from CallExpression initializers like `new Elysia().derive(...)`. I found that handleVariableStatement fails to extract function names from CallExpression initializers like `new Elysia().derive(...)` because it only recognizes arrow functions and function expressions, not call expressions. I'm traversing the AST by visiting children of VariableStatement and CallExpression to extract function names from CallExpression initializers. I'm traversing ArrowFunction nodes by visiting their parameters and body children. I'm recursively traversing AST nodes to identify function declarations within variable statements. 

I'm tracing the AST traversal to confirm descent into VariableStatement nodes. I found that CallExpression initializers are not recognized as function expressions, so they return null and skip the function name extraction. 

**Visiting AST nodes**

I'm traversing the AST by visiting CallExpression nodes and calling `visit(callExpr, null)` for their initializers. I'm using `ts.forEachChild` to traverse CallExpression and ArrowFunction nodes recursively. I'm identifying arrow functions within Block statements by traversing VariableStatements and ReturnStatements. </details></think>

**Analyzing function containment**

I'm examining how nested functions within .derive() callbacks are structured to understand findContainingFunction's limitations. I found that findContainingFunction walks up the parent chain and would identify the VariableStatement for ensureSessionCookie as the containing function. I confirmed that findContainingFunction correctly identifies the containing function for nested arrow functions. 

I'm creating a test to verify that forEachChild on Block correctly visits VariableStatements and processes them in the right order. I'm extracting function names from VariableStatements to complete the call graph. The analyzer marks functions as nested when visiting Blocks with parentFunction = null, causing them to be excluded from top-level reordering. </details></think>

**Reordering functions**

I discovered that the fix reordered functions incorrectly, placing `ensureSessionCookie` before `getSessionId` when the latter is needed by the former, creating a new violation. I realized the topo sort was reversing the order incorrectly for stepdown, needing callees first then callers. I'm correcting the topo sort to follow the 'top to bottom' principle where orchestrating functions appear before their callees. </details></think>

**Categorizing nodes**

I discovered that CallExpression initializers in derive() are categorized as 'other' instead of 'functions', causing fixer to miss them. 

**Reordering top-level**

I'm adjusting the top-level reordering logic to ensure nested blocks are properly processed during transformation. 

**Checking session structure**

I'm investigating the session.ts structure to understand why the analyzer doesn't see certain elements. I'm examining how the callback parameter `({ cookie })` affects the extraction logic and whether findContainingFunction properly handles this pattern. I'm adding a test for the derive pattern to verify the analyzer and fixer behavior. </details></think>

**Verifying db8 behavior**

I've verified db8's behavior and marked it as done. 

**Analyzing dependency extraction**

I found that ctDependenciesFor misses sessionStoreToRepository calls inside composeCartDomain because the dependency extraction only handles direct call expressions, not nested method calls. I need to check if sessionStoreToRepository is missing from the functionNames map, which might prevent detection of nested calls. I found that sessionStoreToRepository should be in categorizeVariableStatement and is missing from the functionNames map. I found that sessionStoreToRepository is defined with export and wasn't included in the categorizeVariableStatement function list. </details></think>

**Analyzing reorder behavior**

I'm investigating why the bead reports 'reordered 0 functions' while the output shows 1 function reordered. I found that composeCartDomain returns an object with nested calls, which may not be traversed correctly by visitNodeForDependencies. 

I confirmed that composeCartDomain's function body traversal will correctly identify nested CallExpressions like createCartPresenter. </details></think>

**Fixing order repository**

I'm reordering functions in order-repository to resolve validation cycle issues. I'm adjusting the topological sort to resolve validation cycle issues between mapValidOrders, parseSingleOrder, and validateAndParseOrder. 

**Analyzing dependency order**

I found that validateAndParseOrder is above mapValidOrders in the file, which follows correct stepdown order with caller above callee. I found that validateAndParseOrder appears above mapValidOrders, but the stepdown rule may actually require callers before callees. I found that mapValidOrders calls validateAndParseOrder, flagging the callee above the caller, violating the stepdown rule. 

**Reordering functions**

I'm reordering mapValidOrders and validateAndParseOrder to follow the stepdown rule with orchestrator code first. I'm reordering mapValidOrders and validateAndParseOrder so the caller appears before the callee, correcting the dependency order. 

I'm reversing the function order to match the stepdown rule where callers should appear before callees. I'm adjusting the topological sort to place `mapValidOrders` before `validateAndParseOrder` as per the stepdown rule. I discovered that `mapValidOrders` and `parseSingleOrder` might be categorized as 'other' functions instead of being properly ordered, which is causing the topological sort to misplace them. I'm adjusting the function placement to ensure `mapValidOrders` and `parseSingleOrder` are correctly scoped within their factory context. I found that `categorizeNodes` only processes top-level nodes, missing the nested `mapValidOrders` and `parseSingleOrder` functions inside `createSurrealOrderRepository`. The transformNestedBlocks function needs to process the body of `createSurrealOrderRepository` to find nested functions. 

I'm identifying top-level functions vs nested functions for reordering purposes. I'm tracing how the variable statement for `createSurrealOrderRepository` gets transformed through nested visits and block reordering. I'm reordering function statements by collecting them, building dependencies, and applying topological sorting. </details></think>

**Reordering functions**

The function reordering fixed the violations, even though it reported 'reordered 0 functions'. The fixer worked correctly; the function order now follows the dependency chain properly. The fixer may place createSurrealOrderRepository anywhere since it contains no call expressions, only property references. I'm reordering functions to place callers before their dependencies, with parseSingleOrder above validateAndParseOrder. </details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Analyzing file patterns**

I'm checking if glob patterns correctly handle single file paths and whether the fixer incorrectly marks files as unfixed. I'm investigating why hasChanges is false by checking for formatting differences between fixer output and original content. 

**Checking fixture resolution**

I'm verifying if the glob pattern resolves the fixture path correctly and whether the FileService reads the original unmodified fixture. </details></think>

Summary of what was done:

## Bead progress

### db8 – Fixer5: Nested functions in callbacks (closed)
- **Finding**: Analyzer already visits callbacks and finds nested functions; fixer (aka) reorders them.
- **Tests added**: 
  - `nested-functions.test.ts`: derive-style callback – analyzer detects violations, fixer resolves them.
  - `fixer.test.ts`: arrow chain fixture – mapValidOrders/parseSingleOrder → validateAndParseOrder.
- **Fixture**: `fixtures/test-arrow-chain.ts` for the 27g-style pattern.

### Current bead status
- **Completed**: obe, aka, db8
- **Still open**: 1e0, 27g, 96h, hje, 0om, 77q, aad (ref), uj1 (feature)

### Remaining beads (by priority)
1. **P0**: 1e0 (dep graph), 27g (arrow ordering), 96h (global opt)
2. **P1**: 0om (idempotency), hje (analyzer–fixer split), 77q (ff-elysia idempotency)

Arrow chain tests pass, so basic arrow ordering works. ff-elysia issues are likely from 96h (non-idempotent reordering) and the global optimization problem.
