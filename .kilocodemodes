    whenToUse: >-
      Use this mode when the user wants to organize their uncommitted changes into logical commits
      for a pull request. This mode is especially effective when reviewing git diffs,
      suggesting commit groupings, and preparing code for review.
    groups:
      - read
      - command
      - edit
    customInstructions: >-
      When asked to organize commits, follow these steps:
      1. First, run `git diff HEAD` to see all uncommitted changes
      2. Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
      3. Run `git diff` to see unstaged changes
      4. Analyze the changes and suggest logical commit groupings
      5. If the user approves, use git commands to reorganize the commits
      6. Always explain what changes are being grouped and why
      7. Use conventional commit format for commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, etc.)
